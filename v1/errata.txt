Issues with the v1.00 PCB
-------------------------

Tang Nano Footprint holes a bit small

PS/2 Footprint holes a bit small

3.5mm jack footprint has six unnecessary mounting holes

PAEN not biased correctly for L/R channel operation (needs to be ~0.5V)

PWM audio could be improved:
- It would be better for the DAC and PWM audio filter capacitors to be
seperate. Then the PWM audio R could be decreased and the C increased
to lower the output impedence and reduce the mains hum.
- It should be bc AC coupled via 10uF capacitors

KeyConfig jumper doesn't allow a simple switch to be connected. It
needs to be a switch to 3V3. This might be hard to fix as it's really
a Nano limitation.

Add test points for VGA output
