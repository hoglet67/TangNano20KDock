Issues with the v1.00 PCB
-------------------------

Tang Nano Footprint holes a bit small

PS/2 Footprint holes a bit small

Phono footprint has six unnecessary mounting holes. The best way
of fitting is to trim the centre pin of the socket so the 6 plastic
legs will go down into the holes.

PAEN not biased correctly for L/R channel operation (needs to be ~0.5V)

PWM audio could be improved:
- It would be better for the DAC and PWM audio filter capacitors to be
seperate. Then the PWM audio R could be decreased and the C increased
to lower the output impedence and reduce the mains hum.
- It should be bc AC coupled via 10uF capacitors

KeyConfig jumper doesn't allow a simple switch to be connected. It
needs to be a switch to 3V3. This might be hard to fix as it's really
a Nano limitation.

Add test points for VGA output

Consider flipping the two layers, so that all the traces are on the
solder side. This would make any modding easier.

Add a Power On Reset RC network for multi-boot (e.g. connected to U4 pin 10).

Improvements for the V2.00 PCB
==============================

Switch to I2C and include:

- ADS1115 ADC and Analog Port Connector

- MCP23017 port expander

- More config jumpers

Somehow magic up two additional pins for cassette in/out

Somehow magic up four additional pins for a full RS232 interface

One idea would be to use a shift register for the tube control outputs (A2..A0, RnW, RSTn, nTube). Another idea would be to use an I2C expander.
