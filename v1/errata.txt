Issues with the v1.00 PCB
-------------------------

Tang Nano Footprint holes a bit small

3.5mm jack footprint has six unnecessary mounting holes

PAEN not biased correctly for L/R channel operation (needs to be ~0.5V)

PWM audio could be improved:
- It would be better for the DAC and PWM audio filter capacitors to be
seperate. Then the PWM audio R could be decreased and the C increased
to lower the output impedence and reduce the mains hum.
